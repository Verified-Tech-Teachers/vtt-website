This is an open-source project that intends to combat the grift in web development by providing some process to identify quality teachers and content creators in tech. It is hosted on a sponsored OSS plan on Netlify. 

Keep up with the project here: https://github.com/orgs/Verified-Tech-Teachers/projects/1

## Contributing

There are different ways to contribute to an open source project:

* file an issue
* submit a PR for an open issue
* validate an issue that has been filed
* submit art for the project
* help with the website
* help with the repo (setting up issue templates, actions, etc)

No matter how anyone contributes, polite/professional interactions are expected.

## P.S.

I will probably do something wrong during the course of this project.
I apologize in advance and I'll specifically apologize when it happens.
I'm not trying to leave anyone out or create worse barriers to entry. 
I'm also willing to learn, so please bear with me.
