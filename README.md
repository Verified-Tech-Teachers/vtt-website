# Verified Tech Teachers

This is an open-source project that intends to combat the grift in web development by providing some process to identify quality teachers and content creators in tech.

P.S. I will probably do something wrong during the course of this project. I apologize in advance and I'll specifically apologize when it happens. I'm not trying to leave anyone out or create worse barriers. I'm also willing to learn, so please bear with me.

## Contributing

There are different ways to contribute to an open source project:

No matter how anyone contributes, polite/professional interactions are expected.
